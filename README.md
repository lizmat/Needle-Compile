NAME
====

Needle::Compile - compile a search needle specification

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Needle::Compile;

my &needle = compile-needle("bar");
say needle("foo bar baz");             # True
say needle("Huey, Dewey, and Louie");  # False
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Needle::Compile exports a single subroutine "compile-needle" that takes a number of arguments that specify a search query, and returns a `Callable` that can be called with a given haystack to see if there is a match.

It can as such be used as the argument to the `rak` subroutine provided by the [`rak`](https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/rak) distribution.
